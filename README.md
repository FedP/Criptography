# Criptography

 - CIPHER: An algorithm that converts plain text into CIPHERTEXT
 - Encryption <<==>> Decription
 - Ceaser Cipher (switch letter by 1)

The caesae cipher is one example of a larger class of techniques called Substitution Ciphers. 

These replace every letter ina  amessage with something else according to a translation.

- Permutation Cipher (grid where message is encrypted by reading it from top-down instead of left-right)

Columnar Transposition Cipher: It's a grid where the message is encrypted by reading it from top-down instead of left-right

- Enigma (Alan Turing)

It's consists in 3 encryption rotor followed by a reflector that goes back to the origin with the result.

The flow goes both ways so if A gives H then H gives A.

The encryption configuration can be modified so then the message changes with it.

From this point the encryption went from hardware to software.

- First cipher software was "Data Encryption Standard" developed by IBM and NSA in 1977.

DES used binary keys that were 56 bits long so there were 2^56 different keys

At that time no-one had enough computer power to find the key except the NSA but in 1999 a 250.000$ computer was able to try all the different keys in just 2 days rendering the DES insecure.

- 2001 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

It is designed to use bigger keys till 256 bits in size making brute force attack much harder.

For a 128-bit key you need trillions of years to try every combination even with today's computers.

AES chops data up to 16-byte blocks, and then applies a series of substitutions and permutatios, based on the key value, plus some other operations to obscure the message, and this process is repeated ten or more times for each block.

- Why only 128 bit keys and not much more? Why only 10 rounds?

It's a performance tradeoff. We need the perfect combination between high level of security and a relatively quick operation.

If it would take hours to encrypt an e-mail no-one would use it.

Today, AES is used everywhere, from encrypting files on iPhones and transmitting data over WiFi with WPA2, to accessing websites using HTTPS.

So far, the cryptographic techniques we’ve discussed rely on keys that are known by both sender and recipient.

The sender encrypts a message using a key, and the recipient decrypts it using the same key.

In the old days, keys would be shared by voice, or physically; for example, the Germans distributed codebooks with daily settings for their Enigma machines. But this strategy could never work in the internet era.

What’s needed is a way for a server to send a secret key over the public internet to a user wishing to connect securely.

It seems like that wouldn’t be secure, because if the key is sent in the open and intercepted by a hacker, couldn’t they use that to decrypt all communication between the two?

- Key Exchange

The solution is key exchange! An algorithm that lets two computers agree on a key without ever sending one.

- One-Way Function

We can do this with one-way functions – mathematical operations that are very easy to do in one direction, but hard to reverse.

- Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

Diffie-Hellman key exchange is one method for establishing a shared key. These keys that can be used by both sender and receiver, to encrypt and decrypt messages, are called symmetric keys because the key is the same on both sides.

In Diffie-Hellman, the one-way function is modular exponentiation. This means taking one number, the base, to the power of another number, the exponent, and taking the remainder when dividing by a third number, the modulus.

So, for example, if we wanted to calculate 3 to the 5th power, modulo 31, we would calculate 3 to the 5th, which is 243, then take the remainder when divided by 31, which is 26.

But how does it work??

First, there's a set of public values – the base and the modulus, that, everyone gets to know. To send a message securely to John, I would pick a secret exponent: X. Then, I’d calculate B to the power of X, modulo M. I send this big number over to John.

John does the same, picking a secret exponent Y, and sending me B to the Y modulo M. To create a shared secret key, I take what John sent me, and take it to the power of X, my secret exponent.

This is mathematically equivalent to B to the XY modulus M.

John does the same, taking what I sent to him to the power of Y, and we both end up with the exact same number!

It’s a secret shared key, even though we never sent each other our secret number. We can use this big number as a shared key for encrypted communication, using something like AES for encryption.

The Caesar Cipher, Enigma and AES are all symmetric encryption.

- Asymmetric Encryption

There’s also asymmetric encryption, where there are two different keys, most often one that’s public and another that’s private.

So, people can encrypt a message using a public key that only the recipient, with their private key, can decrypt. In other words, knowing the public key only lets you encrypt, but not decrypt – it’s asymmetric!

The reverse is possible too: encrypting something with a private key that can be decrypted with a public key.
This is used for signing, where a server encrypts data using their private key.

This acts like an unforgeable signature, as only the owner, using their private key, can encrypt.

- RSA

The most popular asymmetric encryption technique used today is RSA, named after its inventors: Rivest, Shamir and Adleman.

When you connect to a secure website, like your bank, that little padlock icon means that your computer has used public key cryptography to verify the server, key exchange to establish a secret temporary key, and symmetric encryption to protect all the back-and-forth communication from prying eyes.

# Criptography Programming Concept

- Hash

sha256 or Argon2 (better solution)

- Salt

It's a random value added to the password before it is hashed therefore making it much harder to guess

- HMAC Hash-Based Message Authentication Code

It is an hash that also require a password defined by the original creator.

An example is a JSON web Token for authentication on the web.

When I generate a login in a trusted server it generates a token with its trusted key then the client can pass it back so the server can trust him.

- How to share a secret with someone and also allow them to read the original message

- Symmetric Encryption

- Asymmetric Encryption

You use it anytime you to a website https

The browser would automatically find a public key used to encrypt the data sent through the website. The data is then decrypted by the browser.

- Signing (Digital Signature)

Method of validation that secure that a data came from a trusted party.
